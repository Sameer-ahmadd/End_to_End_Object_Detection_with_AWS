# End to End AWS Machine Learning Pipeline for Object Detection

# Overview
* This project covers the development of a machine learning pipeline that incorporates data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment, leveraging AWS services 
 to ensure scalability, security, and efficiency.

# The pipeline includes:
* AWS SageMaker: For building, training, and deploying machine learning models.
* AWS Step Functions: To orchestrate and manage the different stages of the pipeline.
* AWS Lambda: To trigger and automate various steps in the pipeline.
* React, Next.js, Express, and MongoDB: To create a web application for user interaction and job management.
# Features
* Data Preprocessing: Utilize AWS SageMaker to preprocess and prepare data for training.
* Model Training: Build and train machine learning models with SageMaker's built-in algorithms.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance using SageMaker's hyperparameter tuning features.
* Pipeline Orchestration: Use AWS Step Functions to create a scalable and reliable workflow.
* Automation with Lambda: Automate pipeline steps and trigger processes using AWS Lambda.
* Object Detection: Implement deep learning techniques for object detection.
* Web Application: Build a web app with React, Next.js, and Express to interact with the pipeline and MongoDB for data storage.
